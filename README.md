# arduino-data-collection

This repository holds a bunch of Arduino sketches as well as Python code for taking sensor information and writing it to files.
Other features are planned.

# Getting Started:
1. Start by figuring out what port your Arduino is communicating on
    - The port can be found by accessing the Arduino IDE and looking in the bottom right corner.
2. In the `dev_info.py` file, change `DEVICE_PORT` to the port from above.
